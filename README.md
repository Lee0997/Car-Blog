## Our Blog about Cars

# Description

Our Blog will be a descriptive, easy-to-use and highly functional application which will allow our users to delve into the world of cars (particularly car parts). We decided to build this as a passion project and a learning tool to develop our skills with React.js. This application will enable the user to look into our parts, be provided with a description and an image of the product. To us, this appeared to be quite an under-represented field on the internet in terms of blogs and we wanted to rectify that for all the car fans out there.

Installation, Credits, Features, Tests

# Installation

The user will first install the dependencies required in order for the application to correctly function. This can be done by opening the command line integrated in vscode and typing "npm i" - after this, the user will be prompted to run "npm start" which when done, will begin to develop our application and open up the localhost or necessary port in order to view the application online.

# Credits

The project was carried out by myself Lee, Dan, Abdi and Mahmoud

# Features

The blog features a login/registration system using JSON web tokens for sessions. It utilises MongoDB and React in order to render out our single-page application. A dashboard with recent information/enquiries, a contact page in order to get in touch with the team etc.

# Tests

We will be using the built in app-test file in react to develop our tests and ensure everything functions correctly in the current build.
